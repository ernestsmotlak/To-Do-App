# To-Do-App

React, Node.js, Sqlite.

## Current
- Need to add a button after every render of the task in User.js
- Upon button click, the Update.js is shown
- After clicking the button in the Update.js component, the Update.js hides, and shows the updated task.


## Next

- The first fetch of the uuid's in the App.js on start is unnecessary.
    - Instead after logging in, wait a 0.5 seconds and just make the /user/uuid of the user, nothing else is needed.
