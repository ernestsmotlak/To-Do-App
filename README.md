# To-Do-App

Made using React, Node.js and Sqlite.

## Current
- Pass login successful (true/false) into the child components.
    - If ls = true show task components.
    - Otherwise show error message.


- After user is logged in, show all tasks belonging to user.

## Next

- Make routes for user after logging in. 
    - ``` 3000/user/userName -> for user 'userName' ```
    -  ``` 3000/user/aa  -> for user 'aa'```

- User cannot see his tasks beforing logging in. Add some kind of 'security'.
