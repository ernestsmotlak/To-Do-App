# To-Do-App

React, Node.js, Sqlite.

## Current
- Update component: 
    - Button
    - On click needs to make the corresponding list item editable.
    The TaskName, Date and Time need to be put into a placeholder type. See this link for help [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_input_placeholder).
    
    .


## Next

- The first fetch of the uuid's in the App.js on start is unnecessary.
    - Instead after logging in, wait a 0.5 seconds and just make the /user/uuid of the user, nothing else is needed.
