# To-Do-App

Made using React, Node.js and Sqlite.

## Current
- Remake the usersite and loginform components.
- The UserSite.js should be the parent, the LoginForm.js a child.


## Next

- Make routes for user after logging in. 
    - ``` 3000/user/userName -> for user 'userName' ```
    - ``` 3000/user/aa  -> for user 'aa'```

- User cannot see his tasks beforing logging in. Add some kind of 'security'.
